The public life of GoalHUB started during World Government Summit 2017 at the “SDGs in Action” track. The Program is dedicated to the searching for new technological solutions which will play a fundamental role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The World Government Summit is an annual platform dedicated to exploring the future of government driven by technological advances and evolving citizen expectations, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It's “SDGs in Action” track – organised in partnership with UNESCO, UNDP, UNEP, UN DESA, the World Bank, OECD, and the UN Foundation, among others – focuses on government actions to achieve the SDGs.

The 2017 “SDGs in Action” program convened 14 multi-stakeholder teams to identify possible solutions to help Sustainable Development Goals implementation, of which “GoalHUB” was selected as one of the most promising to take forward.

Since then, lots of follow up discussions and working groups were organised in order to clarify the vision of "GoalHUB". The conclusion was quite obvious - Finance is just one of several means of Implementation that will be required to achieve SDGs, rebuild trust and to increase Humanitarian or Development Aid. All of them require a global matching of Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI), multi-stockholder partnerships and finance (Traditional ODA and mainstream public and private finance).

Therefore, "GoalHUB"  platform matches innovations, sources of finance and key players in the SDG spectrum by providing access to new partners & tools, creates new knowledge networks and levering existing ones, allows interactive modelling and synergy between the private sector, governments, civil society organisations, innovators and aid development agencies.

"GoalHUB" provides a unique possibility for Aid providers to track the Aid and be sure that it reaches the beneficiaries; for unbanked part of society – to be identified and get help when it’s needed; for agencies to get Dynamic Statistic Data, which is essential for organising effective Humanitarian or Development AID.
